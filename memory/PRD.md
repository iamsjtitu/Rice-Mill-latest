- Formula: Premium = Rate × (Actual% - Standard%) × Qty ÷ Standard%
- Positive diff = premium (extra payment), Negative diff = deduction
- Sale lookup by voucher_no or rst_no auto-fills form
- Voucher No field added to all By-Product sale entries

## Recent Changes (Apr 2026)
- Paddy Custody Register: "Released (Qtl)" now sourced from `paddy_release` collection instead of `milling_entries` (all 3 backends)

## Previous Changes (Feb 2026)

- Desktop JS + Local Server dynamic export columns parity fix
- Oil Premium Register: new backend (Python + Desktop JS + Local Server) + frontend component
- Oil Premium PDF/Excel export with dynamic columns, party-wise summary, premium/deduction breakdown
- Voucher No field added to ByProductSaleRegister form + table + all backends
- Rice Bran sub-tabs: "Sales Register" | "Oil Premium"
- BP Sale Register now creates auto accounting entries: Party Ledger, Cash Book, Truck Payments, Diesel Accounts, Local Party Accounts (same as SaleBook)
- Oil%, Diff%, Premium columns shown in Rice Bran Sales Register table (linked via voucher_no/rst_no)
- Oil%, Diff%, Premium columns added to BP Sale Register PDF/Excel exports (only for Rice Bran when data exists)
- Oil Premium date-range filter, party filter, bran type filter with ESC close
- PDF/Excel exports optimized for single A4 landscape page (auto-fit columns, compact fonts/padding)

## Permanent Rules
1. Version in utils/constants-version.js + 3x package.json + WhatsNew.jsx
2. Use logger from utils/logger.js - NEVER use console directly
3. NEVER use sed/bash bulk replace on source code files
4. After ANY backend modification, run `bash /app/scripts/sync-js-routes.sh`
5. By-product list is HARDCODED in 7 products - do NOT make dynamic

## Prioritized Backlog
- P3: Triple backend code deduplication
*(Quality Test Report Register and Monthly Return Auto-generation REMOVED from backlog per user request)*
